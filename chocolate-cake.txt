Ingredients
125 gms plain flour (maida)
2 tbsp cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp soda bi-carb
3/4 cup condensed milk
4 tbsp melted butter
1 tsp vanilla essence

Other Ingredients
1/4 tsp melted butter for greasing
1 tbsp plain flour (maida) for dusting

Method

    Sieve the flour, cocoa powder, chocolate powder, baking powder and soda bi-carb in a bowl. Repeat this procedure thrice (refer handy tip no. 1).
    Add the condensed milk, butter, vanilla essence and 4 tbsp of water and mix well. The batter should be of dropping consistency.
    Grease a 175 mm. (7”) diameter tin using butter, dust it with plain flour and line with a butter paper.
    Pour the batter in the tin and keep aside.
    Place a small stand in a pressure cooker, add water covering half the tin and place a perforated plate over it.
    Place the tin on the plate and steam he cake using a pressure cooker without the whistle and steam for 12 to 15 minutes on high flame.
    Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid.
    Invert the tin over a wire rack and tap sharply to unmould the cake. You may alternatively use a knife to loosen the edges of the cake.
    Serve immediately or chilled with hot chocolate sauce.


Handy tips:

    Sieving the flour 3 to 4 times along with the other ingredients induces aeration. This helps in raising the volume of the cake when cooked. However overdoing can reverse the effect.
    To make a quick chocolate sauce, combine 1 cup of cream and 1¾ cups dark chocolate and cook in a double boiler till the chocolate melts. Add 1 tsp of butter, mix well and use as required.
